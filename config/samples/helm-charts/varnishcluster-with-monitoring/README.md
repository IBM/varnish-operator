# VarnishCluster with monitoring

This chart's purpose is to show an example of how a `VarnishCluster` can be packaged into a Helm chart with the monitoring stack included. Feel free to copy the chart and modify it to your needs.

The monitoring stack is built using [Prometheus operator](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-operator) and assumes it is installed already in the cluster. The Varnish operator should [be installed](https://ibm.github.io/varnish-operator/installation.html) as well.

The chart does the following:

* Creates a simple `VarnishCluster`
* Installs and configures Prometheus to scrape Varnish metrics
* Installs and configures Grafana to visualize scraped Prometheus metrics. A sample dashboard is included and available in Grafana after installation.

The example is not a complete solution and does not include PV/PVC creation, secure credentials setup, ingresses, etc. Those parts are left for the user to setup.

## Installation

You will need a backend to actually test if Varnish is working correctly. Use your existing or create one. This example will use a simple nginx server as the backend:

```bash
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
``` 

Clone the repo and install the chart using the local path to the chart:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/varnish-operator.git
$ cd varnish-operator
$ helm install varnish-test config/samples/helm-charts/varnishcluster-with-monitoring --set varnish.backend.selector.app=nginx --set varnish.backend.port=80
```

Note that we've specified the selector for our backend (`--set varnish.backend.selector.app=nginx`) and the port they are listening on (`--set varnish.backend.port=80`)

You should see your `VarnishCluster`, `Prometheus` and `Grafana` pods starting/running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods                   
NAME                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-5c7588df-8wsr6                                      1/1     Running   0          5m16s
prometheus-varnish-test-prometheus-0                      3/3     Running   0          3m7s
varnish-test-grafana-9f584598d-89smp                      2/2     Running   0          3m8s
varnish-test-varnish-varnish-1                            1/1     Running   0          3m7s
```

and the corresponding services created:

```bash
$ kubectl get svc                                            
NAME                            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)           AGE
prometheus-operated             ClusterIP   None             <none>        9090/TCP          4m25s
varnish-test-grafana            ClusterIP   10.111.214.241   <none>        80/TCP            4m26s
varnish-test-prometheus         ClusterIP   10.97.244.131    <none>        9090/TCP          4m26s
varnish-test-varnish            ClusterIP   10.100.142.240   <none>        9131/TCP,80/TCP   4m25s
varnish-test-varnish-no-cache   ClusterIP   10.98.10.22      <none>        80/TCP            4m25s
```

Port forward the Grafana pod to see the dashboard:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward pod/varnish-test-grafana-9f584598d-89smp 3000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:3000 -> 3000
Forwarding from [::1]:3000 -> 3000
```

You can see your dashboard at `localhost:3000`. The login is `admin`, password is `pass`. You will find a dashboard called `Varnish`.

In another terminal port forward your Varnish service:

```bash
$ kubectl port-forward svc/varnish-test-varnish 8080:80
```

Make a request to see metrics appear in your dashboard:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080
