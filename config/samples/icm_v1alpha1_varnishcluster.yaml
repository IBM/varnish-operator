  # Affinity configuration to apply to Varnish pods.
  # For more on affinity, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node#affinity-and-anti-affinity
  #affinity:
  #  podAntiAffinity:
  #    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  #    - labelSelector:
  #        Apply the anti-affinity to all pods that match the following expression.
  #        In this case, it finds pods with label "middleware: varnish".
  #        All labels applied to the VarnishCluster are also applied to its dependent resources, including the Varnish pods.
  #        matchExpressions:
  #        - key: middleware
  #          operator: In
  #          values:
  #          - varnish
  #      This groups nodes according to the label key given.
  #      Technically any arbitrary label can be used for grouping, but there is a set of predefined labels on nodes that are almost always used.
  #      Read https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#an-example-of-a-pod-that-uses-pod-affinity for a good explanation of topologyKey.
  #      topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"

  # Tolerations to apply to Varnish pods. For more on tolerations, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration
  # Also, see the README.md#tolerations for suggested configurations
  #tolerations:
  #- key: "key1"
  #  operator: "Equal"
  #  value: "value1"
  #  effect: "NoSchedule"
  #- key: "key1"
  #  operator: "Equal"
  #  value: "value1"
  #  effect: "NoExecute"

  # PodDisruptionBudgets allow you to tell Kubernetes how tolerant you are about pods going down due to administrative events, such node autoscaling or node upgrades.
  # For example, with "maxUnavailable: 0", any node drain events (possible during node autoscaling and upgrading) are not possible, because the budget does not allow for any pods to become unavailable.
  # For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/ for information on what is considered a "disruption"
  # and https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/ for more about PodDisruptionBudgets specifically.
  # NOTE: there should be ONLY ONE field under this spec - "maxUnavailable" and "minAvailable" are mutually exclusive

  #  maxUnavailable: 0
