### Project status: alpha
The project is in development and breaking changes can be introduced.

Kubernetes version `>=1.16.0` is supported.

Varnish version 6.5.1 is supported.

Full documentation can be found [here](https://ibm.github.io/varnish-operator/)

### Overview

Varnish operator manages Varnish clusters using a CustomResourceDefinition that defines a new Kind called `VarnishCluster`. 

The operator manages the whole lifecycle of the cluster: creating, deleting and keeping the cluster configuration up to date. The operator is responsible for building the VCL configuration using templates defined by the users and keeping the configuration up to date when relevant events occur (backend pod failure, scaling of the deployment, VCL configuration change).
